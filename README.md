# Learning

One of the things I love to do is structure and order things systematically. 
Thus, instead of having multiple repositories that show the technologies I am learning,
one repo can show all these.

**Contents:**
- Angular.js 
- Assembly
- Bash Scripting
- C#
- Next.js `Complete`
- Node.js `Complete`
  - Express.js `Complete`
- Tailwind-CSS `Complete`
- TypeScript

## Why Learn Everything?
There are two answers really, professional & unprofessional and I will state them respectively.
- **Professional:** I believe I am a Universalist & could use this ability to contribute to various fields like AI, Cybersecirity, Mathematics & Software Development.
- **Unprofessional:** I just want to piss-off the tech-bro's that are overly opinionated, a cute rage-bait.
